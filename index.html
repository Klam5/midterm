      <h1>General Idea</h1>
      <p class="tab">League of Legends (also referred to as "LoL") is a team based strategy game. There are two maps in the game,
        summoners rift and howling abyss. In summoners rift, there are five players, each dedicated to a certain position. 
        There are three lanes and a jungle with monsters. Out of the five players, there will be one in the top lane, one in the jungle, one in the middle lane, and two in the bottom lane.
        The main objective is to invade the other team's base and destroy what is called their "nexus." Once a team's nexus is destroyed, that team has lost. You can get gold throughout the game by killing enemies, minions, or monsters in the jungle.
        The major roles/classes in this game are tank, fighter, assassin, mage, support, and marksman. There are currently about 141 champions (characters) in LoL and each of them has a class. It is important to have a variety in each team as they all have their own significance
        and can change the flow of the game (refer to roles tab for deeper explanations). All the champions have different and unique skill sets and there are many different combinations you can pull off with certain champions.
